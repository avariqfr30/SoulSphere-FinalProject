# Artificial Intelligence Final Project - SoulSphere - Deep Learning-Based Virtual Therapist

Sharing about our wellbeing and emotions is crucial for personal and social reasons. On a personal level, expressing emotions contributes to positive mental health by providing a therapeutic outlet for processing feelings and developing coping strategies. It fosters self-awareness and reflection, promoting personal growth. Socially, sharing emotions strengthens relationships by creating empathy and understanding, building trust, and forming a supportive network. It also helps reduce the stigma surrounding mental health issues, contributing to a more compassionate and open society. Additionally, discussing emotions enables collaborative problem-solving, offering diverse perspectives and insights, and enhances emotional intelligence, a valuable skill for navigating social interactions.

In essence, open communication about wellbeing and emotions is a cornerstone of mental health, social connection, and personal development. It not only benefits individuals by providing emotional release and self-reflection but also contributes to a more empathetic and supportive community that values and understands the importance of mental well-being.

Our project will be called SoulSphere. It is centered around giving people that are less likely to talk about their feelings openly with someone else. With our project, we are providing those people with a platform that they can express their feelings, be it frustrations, happiness, sadness, and other feelings. We are going to be using deep learning technologies from Tensorflowâ€™s Keras and natural language processing to achieve a chatbot that is as genuine and as natural as it could possibly be with Artificial Intelligence. We will be utilizing packages such as NLTK, Tensorflow, and Scikit learn.

(Due to GitHub not being able to upload 100+ MB files, users have to run the code to also save the model for use).
