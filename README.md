# Artificial Intelligence Final Project - SoulSphere - Deep Learning-Based Virtual Therapist

We are providing those people with a platform that they can express their feelings, be it frustrations, happiness, sadness, and other feelings. We are going to be using deep learning technologies from Tensorflowâ€™s Keras and natural language processing to achieve a chatbot that is as genuine and as natural as it could possibly be with Artificial Intelligence.
